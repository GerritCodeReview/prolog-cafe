      "message": "Oooh. Here be dragons. You can\u0027t actually do this.\n\nIs this a findbugs thing you are trying to \"fix\"?\n\nhashCode() needs to be stable for an object. But val is mutated to be different things during the execution of a Prolog program. A VariableTerm that was stored in a HashMap as a key needs to have the same hashCode through its life.\n\nThe default java.lang.Object hashCode() implementation gives a stable hash for the variable. I think that makes more sense then trying to define our own hashCode for the object based on a mutable property.\n\nRelying on the object identity hashCode still gets us \"some\" value of a.hashCode() \u003d\u003d b.hashCode() if a.equals(b).",
